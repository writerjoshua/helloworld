# helloworld
I am going to build a website. I like that I can do that with github without having to rely on a third party website to do all of the work. I am looking for a way to express myself as a writer without being subjected to overtly aggressive marketing fads, such as the current bombardment strategy that has overtaken the social media industry.
## I don't entirely understand coding but, sometimes, things makes sense. So, I'll stick with it until something sticks.
